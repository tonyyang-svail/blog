The five major components of the module import search path are the top-level
scriptâ€™s home directory (the directory containing it), all directories listed in the
PYTHONPATH environment variable, the standard library directories, all directories
listed in .pth path files located in standard places, and the site-packages root directory
for third-party extension installs. Of these, programmers can customize
PYTHONPATH and .pth files.
